# The File System üóÑÔ∏è
- The **file system** can be thought of as a big filing cabinet
- Each **file** can be thought of as a piece of paper
- Each piece of paper has information written on it, called **data**
- The filing cabinet is organized into **folders** (also called **directories**)
- Folders can be filled with files as well as additional folders, called **subdirectories**
- Everything within the file system has both a name and a **path**
- A path a string of text, pointing towards the location of your file or folder

## File paths
It's best practice to organize your files into appropriately named folders. For this class, you may a folder named `web-dev/` in your home directory. In here, we might create subdirectories like `assignments/` or `notes/`

Let's see what the path to our `web-dev/` folder would look like

Linux/MacOS:
`/home/Joshua/web-dev/`

Windows:
`C:\Users\Joshua\web-dev\`

## Exploring your file system
On windows machines, a visual representation of your file system can be viewed with the **File explorer**

On MacOS, this visual representation is viewable with the **Finder** app

## Your home directory
Believe it or not, you already intuitively know what your home directory is. It's the folder that has your "Pictures," "Documents," "Music," "Desktop," and "Download" directories
