# File & directory paths üó∫Ô∏è
Files exist somewhere on your hard drive. The location they are is called the **file path**. There are two types of file paths, *relative* and *absolute*.

## Absolute paths
Being given absolute path is similar to being given a full address to someone's house. No matter where you are in town, the absolute path is always the same.

## Relative paths
Being given a relative path is like being given directions to someone's house FROM where you are now.

## Analogy 
Imagine you are giving directions to a friend to get to a specific store in a shopping mall. There are two ways you could give them the directions: relative or absolute.

A **relative path** would be like saying "*Go straight ahead, take the first right, and then take the second left. The store is on your right-hand side.*" In this case, you are giving directions based on the current location of your friend. They need to know where they are starting from in order to follow your directions.

An **absolute path**, on the other hand, would be like saying "*Go to the entrance of the mall, take the escalator to the second floor, turn left, and the store is on your right-hand side.*" In this case, you are giving directions based on a fixed starting point, regardless of where your friend is currently located. They don't need to know their current location, just the starting point you specified.
