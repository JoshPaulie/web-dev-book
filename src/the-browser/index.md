# The browser
Your browser is an application that reads and displays files. Only certain files can be rendered from within the browser: plain text files, audio, images, videos, PDFs, etc.

## Loading local files
When you open a local file in your browser, you are essentially accessing a file stored on your computer or device, and the browser is rendering that file as a webpage. This could be an HTML file, an image, a video, or any other type of file that the browser is capable of rendering. When you open a local file, you are not communicating with any external server or website.

## Visiting a website
On the other hand, when you load a page from a website, you are requesting that the browser fetches and displays the content of that page from an external server over the internet. The website typically consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other files that the server sends to the browser to render as a webpage.

Loading a page from a website involves a series of steps:
1. sending a request from your browser to the website's server
2. receiving a response from the server containing the necessary files to render the page
3. rendering the page in your browser

The content on the page may also dynamically update based on interactions with the website or user input.

## Conclusion
In summary, opening a local file means accessing a file stored on your computer, while loading a page from a website means requesting and rendering a webpage from an external server over the internet.
