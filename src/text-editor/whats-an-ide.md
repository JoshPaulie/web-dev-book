# What's an IDE?
## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Despite the long name, the concept of *Integrated Development Environments* is a really simple. **An IDE is a text editor designed for programming.**

Just like how you'd write a college essay in Microsoft Word rather than Notepad, IDEs empower you to write working code *fast*!

Features include 
- autocompletion (help you code, faster!)
- formatting (which makes sure your code is aligned and readable)
- tag closing (a must-have for web development)
- linting (think "code spellchecker"
- and much more.
