# Text Files
- Like a piece of a paper, a text file is where you can record information
- Sometimes they contain "plain text" meaning they contain human readable chracters (like `.txt`, `.html`, `.css`)
- While other times they are specially constructed to work with certain programs (like Microsoft Word documents)
- We will be exclusively working with plain text files

## Making a file
Making a file varies from system to system, but if using an [IDE](IDEs.md) there is usually a button to create one

## File names and extentions
File names consist of two parts. There's the actual name, followed by the extention. The extention indicates to you the author, as well as the programs you are using, what kind of text is inside of a given file

|    File name     | File type       |                                  |
