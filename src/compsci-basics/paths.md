# File & directory paths
Files exist somewhere on your hard drive. The location they are is called the **file path**. There are two types of file paths, *relative* and *absolute*.

## Absolute paths
Being given absolute path is similar to being given a full address to someone's house. No matter where you are in town, the absolute path is always the same.

## Relative paths
Being given a relative path is like being given directions to someone's house FROM where you are now.

## Analogy 
So if the store is down the street from where you are, you might say "head out the front door, turn right, and it will be on your left." These directions are entirely *relative* to where you are when you give the directions. If you were accross town and tried to head out the front door, turn right and look for a shop on my left, it won't be there, because I am starting from a new point of reference.
