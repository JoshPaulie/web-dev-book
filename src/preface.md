# Preface
This book is written with my classmates in mind. The way projects are structured is as-specified by our professor

# Remember while reading..
- The start of each chapter is (usually) a high level perspective of the topic to be covered
- Don't worry about not totally understand what you're reading, it'll hopefully be explained later in the book
- The content of the book is split into many parts to make the material easier to digest

The book is meant to be short and re-readable. You won't retain everything first pass, so it's most important to finish the book than understand each word
