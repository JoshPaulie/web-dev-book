# IDs
An **ID** is a *unique* identifier that can only be assigned to **one** element on a page

It is often used to identify a specific element in a document, and it should be used sparingly since using too many IDs can make the code harder to maintain

<!--- This section to be moved to CSS chapter (somewhere)

IDs are typically used to target specific elements with JavaScript or CSS, and they can be referenced using the `#` symbol followed by the ID name
