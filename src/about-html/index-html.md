# index.html
The `index.html` file is the default file that web servers look for when a user requests a webpage from a website. It serves as the main entry point for the website and is typically located in the root directory of the website

It is effectively your websites homepage. Note the two URLs below and how the first includes `index.html` at the end, but the latter doesn't. This is because without a particular page specified, the browser will serve the `index` file by default.
