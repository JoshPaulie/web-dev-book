# Attributes
Attributes are properties that can be defined within the tag. Some attributes are specific to a tag, while others can be applied to any tag (*global attributes*)

## Using attributes
The syntax for defining an attribute is: `attribute="value"`

Here are some tags with attributes defined
- `<a href="index.html">` ðŸ‘ˆ `href` attribute
- `<body style="background-color: black; color: white">` ðŸ‘ˆ `style` attribute
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` ðŸ‘ˆ `charset` attribute

## Global attributes
Some attributes are **global** and can be applied to any tag. These include `class`, `id`, `style`, `hidden`, `spellcheck`, `draggable` and  [more](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp)

The most notable of these is `style`, which allows you to write **inline** styling rules for your HTML elements. The style attribute will covered more in the CSS chapter

> `class` and `id` will be covered in the next two subchapters

## Tag-specific attributes
Most tags have "tag-specific" attributes that allow you customize the element's behavior. Because of the how many types of tags there are, and associated attributes, a dedicated chapter on tags is necessary
