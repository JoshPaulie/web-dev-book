# Classes
A **class** is a *non-unique* identifier that can be assigned to *multiple elements* on a page

It is used to group elements that share similar characteristics or styling. Classes are often used to apply styles to a group of related elements

```html
<button id="LoginButton" class="RoundButton">Login</button>
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note how this button element still has an id assigned, but it also has the `RoundButton` class. This is because classes are more of a dress code than a way to identify which button it is
