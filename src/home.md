## AI Content
ü§ñ Some content in this book was first generated by AI, then iterated and formatted by myself. I hope to rewrite this content out, but will remain as helpful placeholder text

- many links pointing to internal and external pages for further details
- no repeating information

> üêß I won't be providing many Linux examples, as if you are using Linux you really won't learn anything from this site. Most MacOS examples apply to Linux anyway.
