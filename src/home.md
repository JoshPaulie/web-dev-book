## Hi! I'm Joshua 👋

I love [learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching). To help myself better understand website development, I'll be autoring this eBook to help me study and provide some insight for those who may be newer to Computer Science

>  🗓️ This book will continue to update throughout the 8-weeks. Suggestions and questions encouraged

- many links pointing to internal and external pages for further details

> 🐧 I won't be providing many Linux examples, as if you are using Linux you really won't learn anything from this site. Most MacOS examples apply to Linux anyway.
